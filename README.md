# test_to_china_company

This is my solution for the problems given me as a test task for laboratory researcher vacancy.

In my opinion, the volume of the task is too large for the test task, although each exercise is quite simple. 
The attitude of the head of the laboratory was also disgusting (too dismissive and arrogant).

UPDATE:
problems 1,2,4,5 are solved correctly.
In problem n.3 I wrote a trash. No idea what happend with me. N.3 is obvious, since there is no a cycle that doesn't contain initial point (geometrically obvious; consider a first point at which we get into the minimal cycle).
